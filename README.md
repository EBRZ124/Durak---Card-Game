# Durak---Card-Game
Semi - popular card game "Durak" recreation but made digital

Current state updates:

--- 06.10.2025. ---

Improved algorithm - minimised line count for the same output.

Added emoticons for cards so that the playes know which type of card they have, not just what the card is.

--- 05.10.2025. ---

A very primitive algorithm where both a player and an opponent recieve a full set of cards and those cards are removed from the big deck.

Fix: Previous code made it so that it deletes the selected card in the deck, but it can still be given to a player, though it causes an error; no longer an issue.
