# Durak---Card-Game
Semi - popular card game "Durak" recreation but made digital

Current state updates:

-- 07.10.2025. --

Changes:

deckalgorith.py - Deck is remade into a single array for easier algorithm making (not the best way, but doable)

cardGUI.py - Added slots where player and opponent can place a card

-- 06.10.2025. --

Improved algorithm - minimised line count for the same output.

Added emoticons for cards so that the playes know which type of card they have, not just what the card is.

Added: 
1. cardGUI.py => The GUI of the potential game that shows both the players and opponents decks (totally fair I know)
2. The program now also shows how many cards are left in a deck.
3. Shows which of the card types is a "trump" card.


-- 05.10.2025. --

A very primitive algorithm where both a player and an opponent recieve a full set of cards and those cards are removed from the big deck.

Fix: Previous code made it so that it deletes the selected card in the deck, but it can still be given to a player, though it causes an error; no longer an issue.


_EXTRA_

Why? -> I want to get better at algorithms and I thought a card game would be a good way to practice, as there are 52 card and 4 types. Therefore sorting them to two players seemed challenging enough for me to figure out the proper algorithm and maybe make something out of it.
